And, if you’re a PyLady (as opposed to a PyLaddie), please indicate that you would like to be considered for a PyLadies grant on that form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s conference goes from Sept. 3 – Sept. 9. The deadline for the PyLadies grant submission is Friday, August 3rd.  We apologize for the short notice, but we know that people need time to make travel plans/request days off from work, etc.  You will hear from us by the end of the week after applications are submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know of a talented, deserving female developer who might benefit greatly from attending DjangoCon, email &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:info&amp;#64;pyladies.com"&gt;info&amp;#64;pyladies.com&lt;/a&gt;.  We’ll do our best to help as many women as possible. Many thanks to the DjangoCon organizers and the Python Software Foundation for helping the PyLadies manage this program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this program is to bring new talent to the Djangosphere by supporting developers and giving them opportunity to make connections in the community. Your support of PyLadies’ outreach efforts will pay off hugely over the long term by improving the diversity of the industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies &amp;amp; Individuals are invited to offer funding for talented developers who have demonstrated or show potential for a serious commitment to diversity in the Django commnunity. Donations will go through the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/psf"&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and are thus tax-deductible, yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please email &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:sponsors&amp;#64;pyladies.com"&gt;sponsors&amp;#64;pyladies.com&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to send a woman developer to DjangoCon.&lt;/p&gt;
